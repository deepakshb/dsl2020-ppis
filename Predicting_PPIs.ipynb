    "Proteins performs a vast array of functions such as: catalysing  metabolic reaction, providing structure \n",
    "to cells and organisms and transporting molecules for one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, proteins are vital and macromolecules, at both cellular and systemic levels, but they are rarely act alone.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Protein can interact with many types of molecules or ith other proteins, for example DNA Interactions with Proteins\n",
    "that play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression, as well as RNA transport and translation. Some PPIs are the basis of several diseaces, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer ans so on.\n",
